UC Berkeley Home IP Web Traces
</h1>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Description</b>
<dd>
This dataset consists of 18 days' worth of HTTP traces gathered from the
<a href="http://www.net.berkeley.edu/dcns/modems/hip/about_hip.html">Home
IP</a> service offered by UC Berkeley to its students, faculty, and staff
Home IP provides dial-up PPP/SLIP IP
connectivity using 2.4 kb/s, 9.6 kb/s, 14.4 kb/s, or 28.8 kb/s wireline
modems, or <a href="http://www.metricom.com/">Metricom Ricochet</a> (approximately
20-30 kb/s) wireless modems.  These client traces were unobtrusively
gathered through the use of a packet sniffing machine placed at the
head-end of the Home IP modem bank; the tracing program used was a custom
module written on top of the Internet Protocol Scanning Engine (IPSE)
created by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang">Ian Goldberg</a>.
Only traffic destined for port 80 was traced; all non-HTTP protocols and
HTTP connections for other ports were excluded from these traces.

<P>

The traces contain the following information:
<ul>
     <li> a total of <B>9,244,728</B> references spanning the period from
	  <b><samp>Friday, November 1st, 1996 at 15:18:59 PST</samp></b> through
	  <b><samp>Tuesday, November 19th, 1996 at 05:52:03
	  PST</samp></b>.  8,377 unique clients were seen in the traces.
     <li> the time at which the client made the request
     <li> the time at which the first byte of the server response was seen
     <li> the time at which the last byte of the server response was seen
     <li> the client IP address (suitably anonymized)
     <li> the client port
     <li> the server IP address (suitably anonymized)
     <li> the server port (always 80 for these traces)
     <li> the presence of the <code>no-cache</code>,
	  <code>keep-alive</code>, <code>cache-control</code>,
	  <code>if-modified-since</code>, and <code>unless</code> client
	  headers.
     <li> the presence of the <code>no-cache</code>,
	  <code>cache-control</code>, <code>expires</code>, and
	  <code>last-modified</code> server headers.
     <li> the values of the client <code>if-modified-since</code>, the
	  server <code>expires</code>, and the server
	  <code>last-modified</code> headers, if present.
     <li> the length of the response HTTP header
     <li> the length of the response data
     <li> the request URL (suitably anonymized)
</ul>

<dt>
<b>Format</b>
<dd>
For the sake of storage efficiency, the (gzipped) traces are stored in a
binary representation.  This
<a href="ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/software/UCB-home-IP.tools.tar.gz">archive
of tools</a>
includes the following code to parse and manipulate the archives:

<ul>
     <li> <B>showtrace</b>: this program will print out a human readable
	  ASCII representation of what is in the traces.  To use, type:
	  <CENTER><CODE>gzcat &lt;tracefile&gt; | showtrace </CODE></CENTER>
	  Take a look at the source file <CODE>showtrace.c</CODE> to see
	  how you can use <CODE>logparse.[ch]</CODE> to write code that
	  parses and manipulates the traces.  All times displayed are as
	  reported by the <CODE>gettimeofday()</CODE> system call.
	  <P>
     <li> <B>anon_clients</b>: this is the program that we used to
	  anonymize the traces.  I include this program under the principle
	  that the anonymization used is strong enough that distributing
	  the anonymization code cannot help anybody break the
	  anonymization.
	  <P>
     <li> <B>timeconvert</B>: a program that accepts a calendar time
	  (i.e. time in seconds since the Epoch, as reported by showtrace
	  and as used in the trace filenames) and outputs the local time
	  corresponding to that calendar time.	  
</ul>

<P>

The <b>showtrace</b> tool will display lines in the following format:
<pre>
848278028:829593 848278028:893670 848278028:895350 23.240.8.98:1462
207.36.205.194:80 2 8 4294967295 4294967295 835418853 170 844
37 GET 9168504434183313441..gif HTTP/1.0
</pre>

<ul>
  <li> 848278028:829593 is the time at which the client made the request
  <li> 848278028:893670 is the time at which the first byte of the server
       response was seen
  <li> 848278028:895350 is the time at which the last byte of the server
       response was seen
  <li> 23.240.8.98:1462 is the anonymized client IP address and the client
       port number
  <li> 207.36.205.194:80 is the anonymized server IP address and the
       server port number
  <li> 2 is the decimal representation of the client headers bitfield
  <li> 8 is the decimal representation of the server headers bitfield
  <li> the first 4294967295 is the if-modified-since client header value
       (note that 4294967295 is 0xFFFFFFFF, which means this header
       value was not present for this entry)
  <li> the second 4294967295 is the expires server header value
       (again not present)
  <li> 835418853 is the last-modified server header value
  <li> 170 is the length of the HTTP response header
  <li> 844 is the length of the response data
  <li> 37 is the length of the anonymized request URL
  <li> &quot;GET 9168504434183313441..gif HTTP/1.0&quot; is the
       anonymized request URL.
</ul>
<P>
The interpretation of the client and server header bitfields are as defined
in the <b>logparse.h</b> header in the tools code.
<P>

The <a href="ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/software/UCB-home-IP.tools.tar.gz">tools
code</a> has been tested on both Linux and
Solaris.  The provided Makefile assumes Solaris - you may have to play with
the LIBS definition for other platforms.  HPUX is a mess; I didn't even
try, but it should be possible to get these tools to work with little
effort.  If you do, please let me know what you did so that I can make your
changes available to the world.
<P>

<dt>
<b>Measurement</b>
<dd>
The Home IP population gains IP connectivity using PPP or SLIP across their
2.4 kb/s, 9.6 kb/s, 14.4kb/s or 28.8kb/s wireline modem, or their
(approximately) 20-30kb/s wireless Metricom Ricochet modem.  There are a
total of roughly 600 modems available via the Home IP bank.  All traffic
from these modems ends up feeding over a single 10Mb/s shared Ethernet
segment, on which we placed a network monitoring computer (a Pentium Pro
200Mhz running Linux 2.0.27).  The monitor was running the IPSE user-level
packet scanning engine and a custom-written HTTP module that reconstructed
HTTP connections from the gathered IP packets <i>on-the-fly</i> and emitted
an unanonymized trace file.  Each trace file was then anonymized and
transmitted to our research workstations for further postprocessing and
analysis.

<P>
The trace gathering engine was brought down and restarted approximately every 4 hours
(for administrative and address-space-growth reasons).  This implies that
there are two weaknesses in these traces that you should be aware of:
<ol>
     <li> any connection active when the engine was brought down will have
	  a possibly incorrect timestamp for the last byte seen from the
	  server, and a possibly incorrect reported size.  We estimate that
	  no more than 150 such entries (out of roughly 90000-100000) are
	  misreported for each 4 hour period.
	  <p>
     <li> any connection that was forged in the very small time window
	  (about 300 milliseconds) between when the engine was shut down
	  and restarted will not appear in the logs.  We estimate that no
	  more than 30 such drops occur for each 4 hour period.
</ol>
<P>
The packet capture tool reported no packet drops.  Considering that a
Pentium Pro 200MHz was used to capture the traces on a 10 Mb/s Ethernet
segment, it is virtually certain that no trace drops besides those
mentioned above occurred.  There may be periods of uncharacteristically low
activity in the traces - these correspond to network outages from
Berkeley's ISP, rather than trace failures.
<P>
The traces do contain entries for requests issued by the client but
that weren't completed (because, for instance, the user pressed the STOP
button and the TCP connection was shut down before the request completed).
Unknown timestamps in the traces contain the value 0xFFFFFFFF
(reported by showtrace as 4294967295), and
incomplete requests contain header and data length values that report as
much header/data was seen.
<P>
The trace data is sorted by completion time (i.e. the time at which the
last bye of the server response was seen, or the time at which the
connection was dropped).  However, because of inaccuracies and apparent time
travel in the Linux system clock, some trace entries appear
slightly out of order.
<P>
All timestamps within the traces are as reported by the gettimeofday()
system call, so these timestamps ostensibly have microsecond resolution.

<br><br>
<dt>
<b>Privacy</b>
<dd>
To maintain the privacy of each individual Home IP user, we have stripped
identity information out of the traces through a post-processing phase.
Because it is very trivial to identify a user based solely on the pages
that the user has visited, we were forced to anonymize the URL and
destination IP address of each web request as well as the source IP
address.  All anonymization was done using a keyed MD5 hash of the data (32
bits for client and server IP addresses, 64 bits for URLs).  <B>We
ourselves do not know the key used to salt the MD5 hash</B>, so don't
bother asking us for it.  Similarly, don't bother asking us for
unanonymized traces.

<P> In order to preserve <i>some</i> information about the URLs, the
post-processed URLs have the following format:
<P>
<CENTER><B><CODE>COMMAND URLHASH.[flags][.suffix] [HTTPVERS]</CODE></B></CENTER>
<P>
where:
<ul>
     <li> <B><CODE>COMMAND</CODE></B> is one of <CODE>GET</CODE>,
	  <CODE>HEAD</CODE>, <CODE>POST</CODE>, or <CODE>PUT</CODE>,
	  <P>
     <li> <B><CODE>URLHASH</CODE></B> is the string representation of the
	  64-bit MD5 hash of the URL,
	  <P>
     <li> <B><CODE>flags</CODE></B> contains the character <B>q</B> to
	  indicate that a question mark was seen in the URL, and the
	  character <B>c</B> to indicate that the string <B>CGI</B> or
	  <B>cgi</B> was seen in the URL,
	  <P>
     <li> <B><CODE>suffix</CODE></B> is the filename suffix, if present, and
	  <P>
     <li> <B><CODE>HTTPVERS</CODE></B> is the HTTP version field of the
	  HTTP command issued by the client, and is one of
	  <ul>
	       <li> HTTP/1.0
	       <li> HTTP/1.1
	       <li> the NULL string (indicating HTTP/0.9).
	  </ul>
	  To our knowledge, however, no HTTP 1.1 requests were observed
	  during the tracing period.
</ul>
<P>
Here are some examples of URLs contained in the traces:

<ul>
     <li> <B><CODE>GET 8252631242092696791.q.map HTTP/1.0</CODE></B> - the
	  client issued a GET request, the URL contained a question mark,
	  the URL ended in the suffix .map, and HTTP/1.0 was used by the
	  client.  An example of a request that may generate this
	  anonymized URL is <CODE>GET /foo.map?BAR=BAZ HTTP/1.0</CODE>.
	  <P>
     <li> <B><CODE>POST 36782605103285618862.c HTTP/1.0</CODE></B> - the
	  client issued a POST, the URL contained the substring CGI or cgi,
	  the URL did not end with a dotted suffix, and HTTP/1.0 was used
	  by the client.  An example of a request that may generate this
	  anonymized URL is <CODE>POST /cgi-bin/foo HTTP/1.0</CODE>.
	  <P>
     <li> <B><CODE>GET 103551731373256697..gif HTTP/1.0</CODE></B> - the
	  client issued a GET request, the URL contained neither the
	  substring [CGI|cgi] nor a question mark, the filename ended
	  with the .gif suffix, and HTTP/1.0 was used.  An example of a
	  request that may generate this anonymized URL is
	  <CODE>GET /image.gif HTTP/1.0</CODE>.
	  <P>
     <li> <B><CODE>GET 41438582632480924518. HTTP/1.0</CODE></B> - the
	  client issued a GET request, the URL contained neither the
	  substring [CGI|cgi] nor a question mark, the filename didn't end
	  with a dotted suffix, and HTTP/1.0 was used.  An example of a
	  request that may generate this anonymized URL is
	  <CODE>GET /foo HTTP/1.0</CODE>.
</ul>

<p>

Privacy was the firstmost concern during this trace gathering experiment -
UC Berkeley and the CS department consider the privacy of the student body
to be paramount, and whenever we had the choice of putting more information
in these published logs at the cost sacrificing the privacy of the traced
users, we have invariably chosen to maintain the users' privacy at the cost
of losing this information.  It is our hope that someday the web protocols
and servers will become secure enough to make a tracing effort of the kind
we have done impossible.
